## Description
    I built this project as a way to re-create a game I used to play with friends. The mechanics only require the use of one button. The entire game was put together using socket-io and phaser 3.

## Installation
    To get started playing go to: https://intense-chamber-74370.herokuapp.com/
## Usage
    To move the player in any direction tap the space bar. Taping the spacebar also fires bullets straight ahead. To turn the player hold down the spacebar. Holding down the spacebar for more than a few seconds launches the player's spin attack.
